Do your homework about the company. You will get a chance to ask a question at the end of the interview. Don't waste this chance by asking something monotonous like" in which department will I be working?" , you will get a regular response like" it will be decided after your training period ".
Instead, ask something intriguing related to something that the company is working on which will make the interviewer know that you did your homework and you are very much interested in the job.
